This is a small practice project. As part of my master's thesis, I surveyed 300 students at three universities in Argentina (UNC, UBA, and UNLP) in 2024 about their political opinions on Milei and socioeconomic indicators. I will now use this data and connect it to APIs from the Argentine government (https://datos.gob.ar/) to plot interesting correlations.

## Results

Here some plots about the survey data:
